A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:

    What the project does
    Why the project is useful
    How users can get started with the project
    Where users can get help with your project
    Who maintains and contributes to the project

If you put your README file in your repository's hidden .github, root, or docs directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.
